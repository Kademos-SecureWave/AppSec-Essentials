# Interactive AppSec Tutorials

Welcome to the `/tutorials` directory of AppSec-Essentials. This section offers a series of interactive, hands-on modules designed to teach you the fundamentals and advanced topics of Application Security (AppSec) through practical, real-world exercises.

## Tutorial Overview

### 1. **Introduction to Application Security**

- **Objective**: Understand the basic concepts of AppSec, the importance of security in software development, and the common types of security threats.
- **Exercises**: Interactive quizzes, a small vulnerable application to explore basic security misconfigurations, and the use of security tools to detect issues.

### 2. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention**

- **Objective**: Learn about XSS vulnerabilities, their impact, and how to prevent them in your web applications.
- **Exercises**: Coding exercises to sanitize user input, implementing Content Security Policy (CSP), and testing your code against XSS attacks.

### 3. **Secure User Authentication**

- **Objective**: Dive into the mechanisms of secure user authentication, session management, and best practices for password handling.
- **Exercises**: Build a simple authentication system, enhance it with multi-factor authentication, and conduct security assessments.

### 4. **Encryption Techniques**

- **Objective**: Get acquainted with encryption algorithms, their use cases, and how to apply them in your applications.
- **Exercises**: Encrypt and decrypt data using various libraries, manage encryption keys, and simulate a secure data transmission.

### 5. **API Security**

- **Objective**: Understand the principles of securing APIs, including authentication, rate limiting, and data validation.
- **Exercises**: Develop a secure API endpoint, implement token-based authentication, and apply throttling measures.

### 6. **DevSecOps Integration**

- **Objective**: Learn how to integrate security practices into a DevOps pipeline, ensuring continuous security evaluation.
- **Exercises**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline, integrate automated security scanning tools, and analyze pipeline security reports.

### 7. **Incident Response and Reporting**

- **Objective**: Explore the steps to take when a security incident occurs, including analysis, mitigation, and reporting.
- **Exercises**: Role-play an incident response, draft an incident report, and develop a post-mortem analysis.

### 8. **Advanced Threat Modeling**

- **Objective**: Master the techniques of threat modeling to identify and mitigate potential security risks in software design.
- **Exercises**: Create threat models for different scenarios, conduct risk assessments, and propose mitigation strategies.
