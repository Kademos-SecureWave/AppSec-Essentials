# Pre-Development Security Planning Checklist

## Introduction
This checklist serves as a quick reference guide to ensure comprehensive security during the development and deployment of applications. It's designed to embed security practices into every phase of the project.

## 1. Threat Identification and Risk Assessment
- [ ] Identify potential threats and vulnerabilities in the system and its infrastructure.
- [ ] Assess the risk of each threat based on impact and likelihood.
- [ ] Prioritize the risks for efficient management.

## 2. Development of Action Plans
- [ ] Develop detailed action plans for mitigating identified risks.
- [ ] Ensure plans are practical and executable within the project scope.

## 3. Security Testing Protocols
- [ ] Conduct both automated and manual testing to identify vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Utilize appropriate security scanning tools.
- [ ] Document the testing protocols for future reference.

## 4. Review and Adjustment Procedures
- [ ] Review the results from security tests.
- [ ] Make necessary adjustments to security strategies based on these results.

## 5. Documentation and Secure Storage
- [ ] Document all security processes and findings.
- [ ] Store these documents securely and ensure they are easily accessible to relevant teams.

## 6. Best Practices and Additional Recommendations
- [ ] Adopt a DevSecOps approach for integrated security.
- [ ] Regularly update and patch open-source libraries.
- [ ] Automate security tasks to minimize human error.
- [ ] Provide security training for development teams.
- [ ] Conduct regular risk assessments.
